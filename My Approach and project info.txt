
CHALLENGES FACED DURING COMPLETING EVERY TASKS:

1. DOG GUESSING GAME:

 Creating a simple interface at the starting was quite easy but the real challenge was to fetch the Api and show random options with a random
correct option each time the image regenerates and keeping every content of dog game inside one single route was also a bit challenging and yes
i did take help of google to complete this challenging yet fun task!

2. RHOMBUS :
   For this one the hardest thing for me was to rotate it at 180 degrees and transforming it while also keeping its shape as a diamond so it took me alot of time to figure out and It also required me to do some google searches as it was a bit challenging for me.

3.DUSTBIN :

  In this task creating the discs and two dustbins were very easy and here i used the react-dnd-html-backend library to implement the drag and drop
functionalities. for this task the challenging thing was obviously draggin and droping the discs from one bin to another while also changing it's
color to the corresponding bin's color.


OVERALL i have used NextJS 14 to complete this project and i have implemented the required file routing method as stated in project description,
As of now i only have knowledge of working with frontEnd in React.


This project was fun and I am eagerly waiting to know what will be the next process further.

Thanks for the opportunity :)
